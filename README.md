# ANN-Default-Model
This is the final project for my Harvard Big Data course. The project aims to build a neuron network default prediction model based on Lending Club data

This project uses Lending Club loan data available to build a fully connected neural network to predict the default probability. The proejct explored how the changes of number of nodes and number layers in the model will impact the prediction results. I also explored techniques to dealw ith overfitting in the model data.
